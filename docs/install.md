# Installation instructions

hdspin requires [CMake](https://cmake.org) to build and [MPI](http://www.mpi-forum.org) to run. It is tested using [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org) and [Open MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org) on both Ubuntu and MacOS latest. Otherwise, every external dependency is self-contained explicitly under the terms of their licences. Installing hdspin should be straightforward using CMake:

## Install CMake and MPI

There are a variety of ways to install CMake and MPI. For example, on Mac, I prefer to use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install cmake
brew install open-mpi
```

Or on Linux, something like this (depending on the distribution you're using and its particular package manager)

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin openmpi-doc libopenmpi-dev
```

> hdspin is not tested on Windows, please use at your own risk!


## Install hdspin

Once CMake and MPI are installed on your system, the rest should be straighforward. First, download the hdspin source code (I prefer `git clone` but you can also download a tarball). `cd` into `hdspin` and use CMake to generate all required makefiles. Then run make (with optional `j8` to use 8 parallel jobs) Something like this should work just fine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:matthewcarbone/hdspin.git
cd hdspin
cmake -S . -B build -DPRECISON=256 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -DSMOKE=ON 
cd build
sudo make -j8 install
```
Sudo permissions are required to install to the directory `/usr/local/bin`, where the first two parts of the path are set by `DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. You can of course choose whichever directory you want, but we recommend putting it in your path so you have easy access to the executable.

Note that at compile time, there are three options for the user to set:
* `-DPRECISON=<INT>` is the maximum number of spins you can use during the simulation. Should be a power of 2 (as recommended by the Arbitrary Precision library). Default is `256`. Note that this is the _maximum_ value you can use for `N_spins` in the simulation.
* `-DBUILD_TESTS={ON, OFF}` is a boolean flag for telling CMake whether or not to compile the testing suite. Default is `OFF`.
* `-DSMOKE={ON, OFF}` controls whether or not to use the smoke testing or not. Smoke tests basically run tests using slightly less statistics, and are generally faster. Default is `ON`.
